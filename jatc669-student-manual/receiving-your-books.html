          <p>Now that you are familiar with how the testing site is set up and can see the courses you are enrolled in, you are ready to begin studying and submitting your course work to Washtenaw.</p>
          <p>All courses in the program have an accompanying study guide.  These study guides contain the questions you are to answer for each lesson quiz along with commentary that you are to read before doing each quiz.  All of these study guides are published for you to read online for your convenience.  We’ll show you how to find your study guides online in the next step.</p>
          <p>In addition to the study guides, some courses use supplemental blueprints and UA textbooks.  Unfortunately, most of these textbooks and blueprints are not available online.  You must wait for the “hard copy” to be delivered to you before you can begin work.  Hard copies of both the study guides and any supplemental materials will be shipped to you after you are enrolled into a course.  Shipping times can vary, with delivery up to three weeks from the date you are enrolled by Washtenaw.</p>
          <p>It is your responsibility to ensure you have all the correct materials you need in hand so you can submit work before your quarterly deadline.  Things you can do to help ensure you have the correct materials:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Always keep your current mailing address on file with Washtenaw.</li>
            <li>Check your WCC student email (see upcoming Step 12) for new course enrollment notices. Also check the links inside your shipment emails for tracking numbers and UPS delivery schedule to your home. </li>
            <li>Contact Washtenaw if you have not received all necessary course materials within three weeks of enrollment.</li>
            <li>Open your packages as soon as you receive them and ensure that the study guide and materials you received match the course you are enrolled in on the testing site.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="panel callout">
            <p>Note: Not all courses have supplemental materials, but all courses will have a study guide.  For specific details on what materials accompany each course, click “Program Courses” found in the testing site’s resource link section.</p>
