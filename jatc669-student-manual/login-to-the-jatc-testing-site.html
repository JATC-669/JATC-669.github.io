          <p>Open your web browser and go to the WCC-JATC669 testing website https://jatc669.wccnet.edu 

Tip: we recommend you now add this site address to your browser favorites.

In order to gain access, you will first need to create your own WCC-JATC669 account.  Click on the link “Creating an account” located on the right side of the screen under the heading “Welcome to the JATC 669 testing site” (shown right).



That link will bring you to the “Set up your account” page (shown left). Scroll down to see the input boxes under “Tell us who you are”.  

Enter your first and name as spelled on your enrollment letter.  Do not enter your middle name or initial.  

Enter your WCC student ID number from your enrollment letter. Include the @ symbol.  

Enter your birthdate in the format MM/DD/YYYY (example: if you were born May 1, 1985, enter 05/01/1985).  

Ensure you have entered all information correctly and then click the button “Continue”. 
 

The next page will ask you to choose a password (shown right).  Before you create a password, read the rules underneath the password input box.  Your password is case-sensitive and it must adhere to those rules.  You must re-enter your password in the second box exactly as you do in the first box.

Under “In case you forget your password”, you must choose three security questions and enter answers for each.  You may select any combination of security questions offered from the three drop-down menus but you must set up all three questions.  Enter your personalized answers in each box under your selected questions.  Unlike your password, these are not case-sensitive.

Ensure you have entered all information correctly, review the terms of services, and then click the button “Agree & Create Account”. 
If you are brought to the screen “You’re Finished!”  (shown right) then your password setup has been accepted.  Your personal netID will be displayed and you are now ready to login.

Click the link “Go back to JATC 669” or type in your address bar https://jatc669.wccnet.edu to return to the login page.

Troubleshooting help: if you are not advancing pages during the setup process and you do not end with seeing the “You’re Finished” page, it means that data you entered was not accepted. You will likely see an “Error” message highlighted in red.  Common errors are due to typing mistakes such as not entering the same characters in both password boxes or not following the format rules. Go back and carefully re-enter your information at each step.

Once you have returned to the login screen https://jatc669.wccnet.edu (shown left), enter your netID and password in the boxes provided.

You should note that your netID is found on your personal welcome letter from Washtenaw and was confirmed again at the end of your password setup.

Enter your password underneath.  Note that while your netID is not case-sensitive, your password is case-sensitive.

Then click the “Login” button to the right to access the testing site and move on to Step 4 in the next page of this guide.


Forgot password?
We recommend you write down your password and keep it in a safe place!  If you are unable to recall your password in the future, you can reset your password by clicking the “Forgot password” link.

You will then be prompted to re-submit your personal information and provide the exact answers you submitted when you set up your security questions earlier.  This process will lead you to create a new password, not retrieve the old one.

If you continue having difficulty logging in or resetting your password, contact Washtenaw at 866-341-8674 while you are at a computer.  Please have your WCC student ID number ready when calling.  Washtenaw staff cannot provide your forgotten password or give you a new one; we can only reset accounts for you to complete a new password setup on your own
