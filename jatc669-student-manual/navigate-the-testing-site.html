          <p>On your first entry to <a href="https://jatc669.wccnet.edu">https://jatc669.wccnet.edu</a> you will be required to understand the <strong>UA Standards of Excellence</strong> and <strong>Washtenaw Community College’s</strong> obligation to release your academic progress to LU669. <b>You must read and check the agree box to access the site further</b>.</p>
          <p>The home page is where you will find the starting links to every application and resource available on the testing site.</p>
          <p>Highlighted in the middle of the home page is an announcement section. Be sure to read these as they often contain important information including deadlines and recent changes to the program that are not covered in this student guide.</p>
          <p>Below the announcement section and also to the upper right of the announcements you will see <code>“My courses”</code> which list only the current courses you are enrolled in and can now submit lessons for. You will not be able to access courses in the program that you are not yet enrolled in or your old courses after you have completed them.</p>
          <p>Down further on the right-side column of the home page you will see a box marked <code>“Student Progress”</code> with your name underneath. <b>This box is your personal lesson counter that you should refer to throughout your apprenticeship for guidance</b>.</p>
          <p>The Student Progress box first shows how many total lessons you are expected to submit for your entire apprenticeship program. Next it shows how many lessons you are due to submit before the end of the current quarter. Finally, it shows how many total lessons you have submitted to date since you began.</p>
          <p>Your quarterly requirement amount will increase the first day of every new quarter.</p>
          <div class="panel callout">
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>This lesson counter will not explain whether or not you were reported as lesson delinquent for any previous quarters. It is only provided as a helpful tool. If you feel its displayed numbers are inaccurate, contact Washtenaw</em>.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Below the Student Progress box you will find helpful resource links, forms, and instructional videos that you can download. To access these resources simply click the links. Some forms and videos may take several minutes to download if you have a slow connection and some links will open a separate window.  We also encourage you to check the <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/spring215.com/file/d/0B7dGPoYN0rWdRFNTRzZaNWcwUTA/edit">“Frequently Asked Questions”</a> resource link often as these questions and answers we have posted are for good reasons!</p>
          <div class="panel callout"><p><strong>Troubleshooting help:</strong> <em>Some forms are in a .pdf format so you must have an Adobe .pdf Reader installed to read these. Videos posted may require an Adobe Flash player to watch. If you have trouble viewing these, get the latest free installations from Adobe.  Instructions on how to do this are available inside the <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/spring215.com/file/d/0B7dGPoYN0rWdRFNTRzZaNWcwUTA/edit">“Frequently Asked Questions”</a> link.</em></p></div>
