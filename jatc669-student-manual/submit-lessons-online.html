          <p>From the home page of <a href="https://jatc669.wccnet.edu">https://jatc669.wccnet.edu</a> click the link of the course you want to work on. You will be taken to a <code>“Topic outline”</code> page.</p>

          <p>The topic outline will show you the link resources available for that specific course and a link for each lesson quiz you can complete for that course. To prepare for each quiz, read the study guide commentary and watch the videos (if available) by clicking the links provided above the quizzes.</p>

          <div class="panel callout"><p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>the study guide commentary provided online is the same text found in the hard copy shipped to you. You do not need to read both. Quiz questions, however, may differ online than what appear in your hard copy book.  Pay close attention to any differences. When you are ready to begin your lesson quizzes, click the link of the first quiz you would like to complete. You will then re-confirm on the next page by clicking the button <code>“Attempt quiz now”</code></em>.</p></div>

          <p>After the quiz page loads, read the multiple choice questions in their entirety before answering. Answer by clicking the circular button next to your selection. Ensure circle is filled before you move on to the next question. You can only select one answer per question. You may change your answers at any time during this stage before you submit the quiz for a grade. If you do not answer a question, that question will be scored as incorrect.</p>

          <div class="panel callout"><p><strong>Remember:</strong> <em><b>Questions presented to you online may differ from those printed in your study guide. 
          Always answer the questions as they appear online!</b></em></p></div>

          <p>The quizzes are not timed; you may take as much time as you need to complete each one. Do note, however, that long periods of web inactivity could result in disconnection from the server. If you need several hours to complete a quiz or if you must exit before you are finished, you may click the button found at the bottom of the quiz <code>“Save without submitting”</code>. This allows you to come back to the quiz later without clearing what you have answered.</p>

          <p>After completing the quiz, click the <code>“Submit all and finish”</code> button at the bottom. A small pop-up will appear on your screen asking you to confirm your submission, click <code>“ok”</code> to proceed.</p>

          <div class="panel callout"><p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>If you exit a quiz without saving or submitting, your answers will not be recorded and you must start the quiz over. Be careful not to close your browser until you’ve received confirmation of either</em>.</p></div>


          <h2>Receiving lesson feedback online</h2>
          <p>Once submitted, a new page will load to display your quiz score and which answers, if any, are incorrect. Review your answers now as once you exit the quiz, your grade will be saved, but you will not be able to retrieve what you answered.</p>

          <p>Correct answers are highlighted in green. If you answered incorrectly, some questions may provide a page reference number or a feedback sentence to the right of the correct answer to help you.</p>

          <p>When done reviewing, return to the main page to do your next quiz or click <code>“Logout”</code> at the bottom to exit. The number of lesson submissions in your Student Progress box will increase by one for each new quiz completed.</p>


          <h2>Re-attempting lesson quizzes to improve scores</h2>
          <p>In upcoming Steps 10 and 11, we will discuss final exams and how final course grades are calculated. The important decision now is whether or not you should resubmit a lesson quiz if you scored low.</p>

          <p><strong>In order to be eligible for a final exam, you must complete all quizzes in the course and have a combined score average of 60 or higher</strong>. If you scored less than 60 on a particular quiz, you should consider re-attempting it in order to ensure your combined quiz average will remain above 60.</p>

          <p>To retrieve each quiz score simply click the quiz link from the course’s Topic Outline page where you first started. To attempt to do the quiz again, click the button underneath your score.</p>


          <h2>How to calculate your combined score average</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Know how many lesson quizzes are required for the course, displayed from that course’s Topic Outline page.</li>
            <li>Add each quiz score up to a total number and then divide that total by the number of quizzes required.</li>
            <li>Example: there are six quizzes in a course and your quiz scores are 60, 80, 70, 40, 60, and 50.  In this case, the combined average is 60 and meets the minimum eligibility to request the final exam and finish the course.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Important rules to know before re-attempting a lesson quiz</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>You may attempt a quiz as many times as you like until the final exam is requested.</li>
            <li>You must wait at least 24 hours between attempts.</li>
            <li>Only the first quiz attempt will increase your total lesson count toward your quarterly requirement. Later attempts can raise or lower your combined score average, but they will not affect your Student Progress box.</li>
            <li>Your latest attempt will always be your current score on record, even if you previously scored better. You should only attempt to do the quiz again if you have studied the text and feel strongly that you will score better than before.</li>
            <li>You may get different questions than what you answered in previous attempts.</li>
            <li>Once you begin a new attempt, you must commit to finishing it, even if it seems more difficult than before.</li>
            <li>After the final exam is requested (see Step 9), you cannot attempt any more quizzes for that course.</li>
          </ul>
