          <p>With the exception of course SPF02, all courses in the program require you to complete a final exam. Each new final exam completed counts as one lesson toward your quarterly requirement in addition to the quiz lessons. Final exams are sent only when you have made a direct request to Washtenaw that you are ready to take it. The exam will always be mailed to your proctor; it should never be mailed to you directly.</p>
          <h2>In order to be eligible to request the final exam from Washtenaw, you must first:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Attend class with a JATC Tutor-Instructor OR have an independent proctor approved by Washtenaw</li>
            <li>Have completed all lessons in the course with combined score average of 60 or higher</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Exams must be requested online or by submitting the exam request form to Washtenaw by fax or mail.  You may not request exams by phoning Washtenaw.</p>
          <h2>Requesting exams online</h2>
          <p>From the home page of the WCC-JATC testing site, click the link <code>“Final Exam Request”</code> found on the lower-right under the <code>“Resource Links”</code> box.</p>
          <p>The next page lists all courses you are enrolled in. If you are not eligible to request a final exam, “not available” will appear next to the ineligible course with an explanation in the notes column. When you do become eligible, an open check box will appear next to the course.</p>
          <p>When you are ready and eligible, check the appropriate box(es) of the course(s) you wish to request a final for.  Ensure that your proctor’s name and address are correct. If they are incorrect, your proctor must contact Washtenaw directly to update their mailing address. Ensure this done before you request the final or else the final will be mailed to the old proctor address.</p>
          <p>When the above is completed, you may add any additional notes for Washtenaw staff and click <code>“Process Request”</code>. A confirmation email will soon be sent to your WCC student email account when received.</p>
          <h2>Requesting exams by mail or fax</h2>
          <p>Each study guide contains a paper exam request form near the end of the book. You may copy or tear out this sheet to mail or fax to Washtenaw. Ensure that all information is completed before submitting. You may submit to Washtenaw the same time you are submitting the remaining hand-graded lessons for that course. The request will not be processed, however, until grades are posted for all lessons received with the request. If your lesson scores do not meet a combined average of 60 or higher, your exam request will be denied and returned to you.</p>
          <h2>Processing your exam request</h2>
          <P>Once your request is submitted, allow Washtenaw up to three business days to package your exam. A confirmation email will be sent to you (see page 12) after your request is approved. Contact Washtenaw if you have not received a confirmation email within three business days of your request.</p>
          <p>Once mailed by Washtenaw, allow up to an additional two weeks for your exam to arrive to your proctor. USPS holidays and delays may add to mailing time - so plan ahead, do not procrastinate and always allow generous amounts of time!  Under no circumstances will exams be expedited. Requests for exams to be prioritized over other apprentices, sent express mail or by commercial carrier, or processed before grades are posted will be denied.</p>

          <h2>Submitting Lessons and Finals: IT TAKES TIME!</h2>
          <p>Here’s a common example of how long some processes take, particularly when it comes to hand-graded lessons that must be submitted by mail.</p>
          <p><strong>John is ready to submit his remaining SPF07 lessons on May 21. He wants to take the exam and be eligible for a new course enrollment before the end of quarter which is June 30.</strong></p>
          <div class="row">
            <ul class="small-12 medium-8 medium-centered columns">
              <li><strong>May 21:</strong> John mails SPF07 lessons 15-17 to Washtenaw.</li>
              <li><strong>May 28:</strong> Because of a holiday and USPS delays, his lessons aren’t received by Washtenaw until May 28.</li>
              <li><strong>May 31:</strong> John’s lesson grades are posted by Washtenaw and he is now eligible to request his exam.</li>
              <li><strong>June 1:</strong> John immediately submits his final exam request online.</li>
              <li><strong>June 3:</strong> John’s request is processed and his exam is mailed to his Tutor-Instructor.</li>
              <li><strong>June 11:</strong> After more USPS delays, John’s exam is received by his Tutor-Instructor.</li>
              <li><strong>June 15:</strong> John takes his exam at his next class session which is scheduled for June 15. </li>
              <li><strong>June 17:</strong> John’s Tutor-Instructor mails exam to Washtenaw.</li>
              <li><strong>June 21:</strong>  John’s SPF07 exam is received by Washtenaw.</li>
              <li><strong>June 27:</strong> John’s final grade is posted – and he passed!  His final is counted toward his quarterly requirement and he is eligible to receive a new course enrollment in the nick of time before the end of the quarter – but barely!  Had he waited another week or had there been more USPS delays… you can see where a lot factors can affect this process so ALWAYS ALLOW FOR TIME!</li>
